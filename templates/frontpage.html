                The <strong>AWI AI COATING TOOL</strong> is a powerful tool designed using AI and optical concepts to
                help engineers and researchers model and simulate optical coatings. It enables you to design complex
                multilayer structures and evaluate their optical properties, such as reflectance, transmittance, and
                absorptance, across a range of wavelengths.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Whether you're working with Bragg reflectors, antireflective coatings, or any other optical stack, this
                simulator provides accurate results based on input parameters like layer thickness, material properties,
                and incoherence levels. It is especially useful for optimizing your design and improving the performance
                of optical systems.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                You can customize the stack's design, simulate light propagation, and optimize the thicknesses of the
                layers to achieve the desired optical performance. It's an essential tool for anyone involved in optical
                engineering, material science, or photonics research.
